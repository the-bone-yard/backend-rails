# The Bone Yard -- backend-repo (Rails)
<br/>The idea behind this application is to address the issue of there not being an app currently that allows a dog owner to set up play dates for their dog, with other dogs in the area, in a safe and secure way.<br/><br/>The main application can be found [here](https://the-bone-yard-fe.herokuapp.com/#/). As of right now a user can navigate to that website and search for dog parks that are near their current location or a specified city/state. The idea is to eventually be able to set play-dates with other owners in a safe way.

## Purpose

[The front-end repo can be found here](https://github.com/the-bone-yard/frontend). This repo is meant to serve as the backend portion of The Bone Yard application.

## Using the API

- The application main page can be found here: https://boneyard-be.herokuapp.com/. If you visit that URL as is, you'll see a generic landing page. To access an endpoint you'll need to submit an inquiry to one of the contributors of this repo. We will then give you access to the various end-points. The endpoints that are functional so far;

  1. Finding all dog parks nearby
  2. Find a specific dog park
  3. Get directions from your current location to a specific dog park
